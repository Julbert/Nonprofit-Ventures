# Nonprofit Entrepreneurship: Course Materials

Here are some rough ideas about how to structure the actual content of the course itself..

## Business/Entrepreneurship Content

* Business model canvas
* Lean Startup
* Funding and Invement (why vs. why not?)
* Management Styles
* Open-Source and IP
* Scalability and Platform Businesses
* etc..

## Philosophical content

* Creativity
* Activism
* Spirituality (in a non-religious sense)
* Self-care
* How to lead a meaningful life
* etc..

Half the battle is getting folks into the right mindset.  When the intentions are pure, the path will appear..   :-)
