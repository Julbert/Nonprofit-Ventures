# Scaling Up: Hierarchy to Decentralization

* The qualities/skills needed for launching a successful startup aren't the same qualities/skills needed for growing a scale-up
* Once an organization has hit a critical mass, charismatic leaders with vision aren't quite as helpful anymore
  * In fact charismatic leaders can become harmful if they turn into an organizational bottleneck
* Hierarchy has its place when an organization is small - because there's insufficient staff to delegate things to
* However to be a good leader in a scale-up, you have to step out of your peopleâ€™s way
* The staff needs to start running the organization in a decentralized fashion
  * Holocracy/Teal/etc..
* Leaders become more effective by listening more, and doing less
  * See the 'Tao te Ching' by Lao Tzu
  * It has a lot to say about this style of leadership
  * Excellent book: 'The Tao of Leadership'
* More good reading:
  * 'Scaling Up' by Verne Harnish
