# Scaling Up: Hierarchy to Decentralization

* The qualities/skills needed for launching a successful startup aren't the same qualities/skills needed for growing a scale-up
* Once an organization has hit a critical mass, charismatic leaders with vision aren't quite as helpful anymore
* At that point, to be a leader, you have to step out of your peopleâ€™s way
* The staff needs to start running the organization in a decentralized fashion (Holocracy/Teal/etc..)
* Leaders become more effective by listening, and doing less
  * See the 'Tao te Ching' by Lao Tzu
  * It has a lot to say about this style of leadership
