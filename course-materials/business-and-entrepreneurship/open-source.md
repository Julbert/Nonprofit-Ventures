# Open-Source

* FLOSS Business Model = give away the products, sell the services
* There's LOTS of successful examples of companies who did this!
  * Oldskool: Redhat, MySQL, Xen, etc..
  * New Generation (DevOps): Docker, Chef, Puppet, MongoDB, Hortonworks, Elastic, etc..
* Common protests:
  * But we need to pay our bills!
  * Services aren't scalable
  * It's harder to get funding
  * Won't competitors steal our IP?
  * Customers won't take us seriously

## Addressing the Common Protests

* But we need to pay our bills
  * Selling products creates a financial barrier to entry for users
  * In today's world of business you need to 1) get users, 2) monitize them
  * So why hurt your ability to attract potential users by charging licensing fees?
  * You can make (more than) enough money selling services

* Services aren't scalable
  * Really?
  * We are now living in the era of the platform and exponential business
    * Uber, AirBNB, etc..
  * Please tell me again about how services aren't scalable
  * I would wager to say that services are actually *more* scalable than products right now

* It's harder to get funding
* Won't competitors steal our IP?
* Customers won't take us seriously
