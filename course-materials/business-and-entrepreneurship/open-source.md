# IP and Open-Source

* FLOSS Business Model = give away the products, sell the services
* There's LOTS of successful examples of companies who did this!
  * Oldskool: Redhat, MySQL, Xen, etc..
  * New Generation (DevOps): Docker, Chef, Puppet, MongoDB, Hortonworks, Elastic, etc..
* Common protests:
  * But we need to pay our bills!
  * Services aren't scalable
  * It's harder to get funding
  * Won't competitors steal our IP?
  * Customers won't take us seriously

## Addressing the Common Protests

* But we need to pay our bills
  * Selling products creates a financial barrier to entry for users
  * In today's world of business you need to 1) get users, 2) monitize them
  * So why hurt your ability to attract potential users by charging licensing fees?
  * You can make (more than) enough money selling services

* Services aren't scalable
  * Really?
  * We are now living in the era of the platform and exponential business
    * Uber, AirBNB, etc..
  * Please tell me again about how services aren't scalable
  * I would wager to say that services are actually *more* scalable than products right now

* It's harder to get funding
  * Why do you need funding anyways?
  * Services don't require a huge upfront investment
  * "B2B Crowdfund" R&D on your products by selling services
  * Bootstrap and/or grow your business without giving up control
  
* Won't competitors steal our IP?
  * "Not Invented Here" syndrome
  * When competitors steal your stuff, it's actually a compliment
  * It's hard work to steal someone else's product
    * Your product is probably buggy and needs to be maintained
    * It's less work to upstream changes than to keep them for yourself
    
* Customers won't take us seriously
  * Win the hearts of a few geeks and they will FIGHT to get you into their company
  * Open-source is the best sales and marketing that you can't buy
    * Conference talks, newspaper articles, word of mouth, etc..
  * DevOps-style evangelism works!

* Other benefits of open-sourcing your IP:
  * Makes hiring easier - the most talented geeks are idealistic.  :-)
  * It's just more fulfilling - life is about more than just profit
