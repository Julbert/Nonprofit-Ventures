# Starting Out: A Stone Soup Story

* Describe the "Stone Soup" parable:
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup
* As a startup founder, you need a vision that everyone can contribute to
  * All of the pieces that you need are out there in the universe
  * Skilled people, IT support, launching customers, etc..
  * If everyone contributes their small part, the larger vision can be realized
  * If you believe in it enough, so will everyone else
  * You write your own "fairy tale" and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy

* A few other things when starting:
  * It's all about the team (start with A+ players)
  * Quality is EVERYTHING! (go the extra mile to make customers ecstatic)
  * It's easier to start with a problem than with a solution
    * Starting with a solution = "I have a hammer, let's find nails"
  * It's cheaper/easier to bootstrap with services than products

* Questions to ask yourself:
  * What pain is my company addressing?
  * Who is willing to pay to have this pain lessened?
