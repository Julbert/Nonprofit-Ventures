# Starting Out: A Stone Soup Story

* Describe the "Stone Soup" parable:
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup
* As a startup founder, you need a vision that everyone can contribute to
  * All of the pieces that you need are out there in the universe
  * Skilled people, IT support, launching customers, etc..
  * If everyone contributes their small part, the larger vision can be realized
  * If you believe in it enough, so will everyone else
  * You write your own "fairy tale" and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
