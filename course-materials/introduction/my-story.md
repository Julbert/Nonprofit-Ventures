# My Story

* To provide some background context for these materials, I will tell a bit about myself
  
## Personal History

* My name is Melanie Rieback - nice to meet you.   :-)
* I was born in Ohio in 1978, lived briefly in Illinois, and grew up in South Florida
* I was always a computer geek ever since I can remember
  * My parents were both "techies" who worked at AT&T Bell Labs (in Naperville, IL) back in the day
  * My mom was a C programmer, and my father was a product manager for telecommunications hardware
  * I grew up with green and black terminals, 8 inch floppy disks, and 300 baud modems
  * I spent a misguided youth playing Nethack and Infocom games, and dialing into BBS systems
    * I was interested in hacking, but too scared to pursue the interest (because it was illegal)
    * Instead I programmed my own simple computer games using GW Basic
  * I had no clue what I wanted to do when I grew up (astronaut? paratrooper? superhero?)
* In high school, my big passion was music (oboe and clarinet)
  * I played in several honors bands and had a paid gig in a semi-professional orchestra
  * I performed the 'Cimarosa Concerto for Oboe and Strings' (with a full orchestra) as a soloist twice
  * Applied to University of Florida music school (on oboe) and got in.
  * But decided that I'd have a rough future as a professional oboist.
  * So I decided to study something else instead.
* BSc. in Biology and Company Science at University of Miami
  * My parents said that "I needed to be a doctor or a lawyer" and I knew that I didn't want to be a lawyer.
  * So I enrolled as a pre-medical student (Biology major) at the University of Miami
  * While taking core courses, I realized that computer science was fun
  * So I added a 2nd major (computer science), so I could take more computer classes
  * I combined these two majors in the obvious direction (bioinformatics)
    * I did my Bachelors thesis on molecular modeling
    * I found a summer job (in Jerusalem) in proteonomics, inspired by a Dutch friend of mine in Miami
    * (Thus started my travel addiction - and my initial interest in the Netherlands.)
  * At the end of my Bachelors, all of my friends were applying to medical school
    * I had good grades and test scores - and could have done the same.  But something didn't feel right.
    * So instead, I decided to take a year off to work, so I could reflect before making a decision.
* My first job: Whitehead Institute / MIT Institute for Genome Analysis
  * I got a job at the Whitehead Institute (now called the Broad Institute) on the public half of the "Human Genome Project"
  * This was back in 2001, during the public-private race to sequence the human genome for the first time.
  * I was in the public half of the "genome race" - it was an interesting time
  * I am one of the thousands(!) of co-authors of the initial paper sequencing the human genome in Nature.
  * I realized at a place like MIT that there is a glass ceiling only having a bachelors degree.
  * I also realized that I enjoyed computer science more than biology.
  * So I decided to go to back graduate school, to get an advanced degree in computer science.
* MSc. in Computer Science (Technical Informatics) at Technical University of Delft
  * (add more detail here)
