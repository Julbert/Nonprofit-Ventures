# Who is this for?

* Left-brain folk (rational thinkers, scientists, engineers, corporates)
  * Business and ICT professionals may want to find more meaning in their work
  * (Aspiring) social entrepreneurs can optimize their startups/scale-ups for positive social impact
  * Foundations and NGOs to learn how business might be more flexible and scalable than their current legal forms

* Right-brain folk (creatives, activists)
  * Activists and civil society folks can harness business to create sustainable vehicles for positive change
  * Creative artists (art, music, writing, performance, etc..) can leverage entrepreneurship to make their art financially sustainable

* I believe that we need a combined left brain-right brain approach for entrepreneurship
  * Business schools and "startup incubators" have a tendency to focus upon left-brain (practical) topics
  * Creatives sometimes shun left-brain activities, especially business (and even success itself) viewing it as a corrupting and/or invalidating factor
  * Both approaches miss the mark - I believe that the ideal solution is somewhere in the middle
