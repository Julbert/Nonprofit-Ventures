# Nonprofit Entrepreneurship: Introduction

These course materials:
* Introduce the concept of Nonprofit Companies and Nonprofit Social Entrepreneurship.
* Provide the aspiring social entrepreneur with business tools and knowledge.
* Provide philosophical context to address the question: why?

I approach business in the most holistic sense - it is mixing self-actualization, making a living, meaningful work, and social benefit.

* Business as a creative art form
* Business as a form of spirituality
* Business as a form of self-expression
* Business as a form of activism

In this context, non-profit business starts to make a lot of sense
