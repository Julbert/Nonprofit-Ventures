# Nonprofit Entrepreneurship: Introduction

* These course materials:
  * Introduce the concept of Nonprofit Companies
  * Promote Nonprofit Social Entrepreneurship
  * Provide a mix of business/entreprenurial and philosophical content

I approach business in the most holistic sense - it is mixing self-actualization, making a living, meaningful work, and social benefit.

* Business as a creative art form
* Business as a form of spirituality
* Business as a form of self-expression
* Business as a form of activism

In this context, non-profit business starts to make a lot of sense
