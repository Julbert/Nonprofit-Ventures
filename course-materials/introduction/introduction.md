# Nonprofit Entrepreneurship: Introduction

* This is a collection of notes, based upon my own experiments with Nonprofit Business model hacking
 
* We will explain the concept of Nonprofit Companies and Nonprofit Social Entrepreneurship.
* These notes will also cover:
  * Business tools that can be useful for starting + running an organization
  * Philosophical context to address the question: why?

* "Business" is approached in the most holistic sense - as mixing self-actualization with making a living, and increasing social equality and benefit
* The vehicle of business is outstanding for creating sustainable positive social impact
  
* Nonprofit business will not necessarily be appropriate in all situations nor will it solve all social ills.
* But nonprofit entrepreneurship is an interesting and promising concept that should be further explored
