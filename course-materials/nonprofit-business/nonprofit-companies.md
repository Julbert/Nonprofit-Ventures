# Nonprofit Companies

## Why Nonprofit Companies?

* The purchasing power of companies and governments is a powerful force
* Companies vote with their Euros for the world that they want to live in
* It's a choice to support social entrepreneurs and local initiatives

* Affect change via purchasing - not donations or subsidies

* Companies want non-profit suppliers.
  * Companies want suppliers where they know the supplier works based on situation where the quality/correctness of
the product is key to the way the supplier does business, and not the urge to 
make as much money as possible off the product, or the pressure of share holders
to make the product as cheaply as possible. This is often reflected in the phrase
where "some huge accomplishment" was based on "the lowest bidder". A "non-profit 
supplier" can become a very successful and wealthy supplier, but not based on a drive to extract as much money from the process as possible. A company wants a supplier where profit is not the primary motivation, or even the secondary.  Profit may be necessary to survive and grow, but it should not be a motive all by itself.

## The Definition of a Nonprofit Company

*	A Nonprofit Company is a combination of a Foundation (Stichting) and Company (BV), where the foundation holds 100% of the shares of the company.
*	The following restrictions are written into both the company and foundation statutes
  * ALL decisions and operations, large and small, should be in service of a well-defined social mission
	 *	No exits (selling the company / acquisition-mergers / IPO)
	 *	No investors (no angel, no VC, no impact, limited subsidies?)
	 *	Cap on salaries of staff (including the founders and director)
  *	Any profits (cash that leaves the company as dividends) must go to a specified Nonprofit Foundation
	 *	Define a maximum amount of cash the company can have in the bank before profits MUST be given to the Nonprofit Foundation 
  *	Fair working conditions for staff
	 *	The statutes cannot be changed, to undo these restrictions

* Contract law would then fulfill the same function that our FFI is currently filling, but without the tax break and without requiring the buy-in of the tax authorities.
