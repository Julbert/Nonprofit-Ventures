# Social Entrepreneurship

* What is social entrepreneurship?
  * There's lots of different definitions
  * But in general, it's an "impact-first" business
  
* Why social entrepreneursip?
  * Business is the problem.  Business can also be the solution.
  * The solution to many societal and global problems is rooted in social entrepreneurship - decentralized and human-based
  * In today's political climate, subsidies and donations are drying up
  * The ability to financially stand upon one's own feel is achieving sustainability
  
* charities are frequently inefficient/ineffective because they lack the feedback mechanisms from the market that businesses would have.
  * The folks paying (the donors) aren't the same people are the folks receiving the services.
  * Thus the donors receive little to no feedback about the actual impact that their investment is having. (And they CERTAINTLY don't experience that impact themselves.)
  * This is one leg-up that social enterprises have - if they aren't serving their market effectively, it will go out of business.
  * So it enforces that feedback loop...
