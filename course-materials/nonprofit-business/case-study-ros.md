## What is ROS?

* [Radically Open Security](https://radicallyopensecurity.com) is the world's first nonprofit computer security consultancy company
* Over 60 customers so far (including many repeat customers)
  * This includes: Google, Mozilla (MOSS project), Dutch government, banks, insurance companies, media companies, hospitals, department stores, supermarket chains, hosting providers, SW development companies, law firms, SMEs, NGOs, non-profits, and the most tiny civil society groups
* We operate financially on a "Robin Hood" model of pricing
  * Multinationals and huge organizations pay a lot
  * Small SMEs and startups get lower prices
  * "Non-profit work" at cost-price for non-profits, small NGOs, and civil society groups
* Collective of ~35 freelancers (and/or partner SMEs)
* Core principles = openness, transparency, open-source
  * We give away ALL of our tools, frameworks, trainings, documents, etc.. for free as open-source
  * Peek Over Our Shoulder is changing how ethical hacking (pentesting) is being done
    * We invite customers to join us in chatrooms, to observe our ethical hackers working
    * This optimizes for knowledge transfer - which is important to teach the "security mindset"
  * We are slowly disrupting the Dutch security consultancy industry (in a positive way)
* We have won lots of prizes:
  * 50th most innovative SME in the Netherlands (2017)
  * Most innovative IT leader - CIO Magazine NL (2017)
  * ISOC.nl Internet Innovation Award (NetAidKit)
  * Internet Freedom Festival Tool Showcase (NetAidKit)
  * Entrepreneurship awards (Sprout Challenger 50)

## The Way Forward 

* ROS is far enough along to serve as a successful case study now.
  * Now we can start teaching other people how to do it
  * This can go from a company to a community
  * And from a community to a movement
