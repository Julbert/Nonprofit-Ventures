# Fiscal Fundraising Institutions

* What is a Fiscal Fundraising Institution
  * Fiscal corporate category from the Dutch tax authorities
  * Originated from the Dutch Churches
    * Language Institute Regina Coeli and "The Nuns of Vught"
    * Allows churches to perform "commercial activity", and then get the money with a tax benefit back to the church again
    * But it doesn't have to be a church who starts an FFI - any ANBI Stichting (Foundation certified for the public good) can do this
 * Explanation (in Dutch): [Fiscaal Fondswervende Instelling](https://vfsa.nl/kennisbank/fiscaal-fondswervende-instelling/)

* FFI principles:
  * Non-profit = 90% (or more) of profits given to charity (ANBI Stichting)
  * Maximum amount of cash in the bank
    * Specific amount negotiated with Dutch tax authorities
    * In our case (ROS), we are only allowed to have 1 year's worth of turnover in the bank.
    * We are forced to give anything above that to our foundation (NLnet).
  * Required number of volunteers

* To research:
  * How many FFIs in the Netherlands?
  * Who are they?
  
* Similar constructions (internationally):
  * LC3 (USA)
  * I've heard rumors that there's similar constructions in Canada and Great Britain - but don't know what they are yet
  * Needs to be confirmed: I heard that foreigners (living outside of the Netherlands) can also create and run Dutch FFIs
