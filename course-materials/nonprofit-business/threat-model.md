# Conflicts of interest 

* BTW.. I had a very interesting question yesterday from the Registered Controllers at the VRC conference: "why did you choose a fiscal form for your social enterprise that makes us immediately think of tax evasion?"
* I thought that was an interesting question.. ðŸ˜‰
* The fiscalists apparently look at FFIs as a way of trying to avoid paying taxes.
* Good to know. ðŸ˜‰
* I actually got similar questions from folks at Social Enterprise NL. They wanted to know if we couldn't possibly use our business construction to do fraudulent things
* Of course, that's possible.
  * If someone's company subcontracts themselves out to an FFI for rediculous rates and a worthless service, that's probably the easiest way to commit fraud using an FFI.
* I think that this is something that we'll need to specifically address, since the question will come up more often.
* It's good to do a study of how FFIs can be abused. (And then think of ways to modify the aktes to prevent that from happening).
  * This could also include things like: having the Stichting sell the shares of the BV/FFI later for commercial gain.
  * Both the aktes of the Stichting and the BV/FFI should prevent this from happening
* Folks have also asked if my being in both the Stichtingsbestuur AND being the Director of ROS isn't a conflict of interest.
* Those are good questions, which I don't have an immediate answer for.
* But I think that I should start looking for answers.
