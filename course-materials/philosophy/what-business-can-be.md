# What Business Can Be

* Business was originally nothing more than a collaboration between people to achieve a greater goal
  * However, at some point the concept of business got bastardized
  * Business is now about creating value for shareholders, cofounders, special interests, and banks
  * But it doesn't have to be this way..

* Business is an excellent vehicle for positive impact 
  * "Corporate personhood" - nonsense, but it gives lots of freedom
  * The only restrictions are: 1) obey the law, and 2) cover your costs
  * For the rest, you can do whatever you like with a business
  * That is what makes them such excellent vehicles for making the world better
    * More more so than Foundations or Associations
    * Nonprofit Foundations are restricted in their kinds of activities and/or amount of growth
    * They are dependent upon subsidies and donations - which isn't sustainable
    * Subsidies and donations are drying up in today's political climate
    * Which is why businesses become an attractive option for achieving financial stability (= long-term viability) of your nonprofit and/or social endeavor.

* Philosophically we should consider:
  * Business as a creative art form
  * Business as a form of spirituality
  * Business as a form of self-expression
  * Business as a form of activism
* This is all possible, but requires a different way of thinking
* In this context, non-profit business starts to make a lot of sense
