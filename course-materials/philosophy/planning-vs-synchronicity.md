# Planning vs. Synchronicity

* People are different in their working habits (structure vs. agility)
  * There is no right or wrong
  * But you won't be able to predict what you need in the very beginning, if you're working on a project of any complexity
* Developing and running a company is a process
  * Kaizen (continuous improvement)
  
* Most opportunities will come from weird corners of your life
  * This includes: customers/staff/ideas
  * You can't plan or architect this
  * However it does help to get yourself out of the house
  * Talk with as many people as possible and "steal" their good ideas
    * New Testament: "There's nothing new under the sun"
    * The best ideas are unique combinations of other people's input + feedback.
  * Be open to receiving inspiration from any place at any time
