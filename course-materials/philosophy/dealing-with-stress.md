# Dealing with Stress

* Pace yourself
  * Remember that running a business is an (ultra-)marathon, not a sprint
  * Take small steps everyday, and you will get there
  * Striving after goals can be motivating
    * But sometimes, ironically, achieving them can be demotivating
    * Direction can be more important than goals (see: ACT therapy)

* Dealing with criticism
  * There will always be people who don't like what you are doing
    * These might be (ex-)coworkers, competitors in the market
    * It might also be family, friends, etc..
  * Listen gracefully to their criticism - there is always an element of truth in what they say
  * Learn what you can from criticism, and then unconditionally accept and love yourself
    * You are doing the best that you can
    * Nobody is perfect - and that's okay.
  * Remember that you can't make everyone happy
    * It's not necessary either.
    * Just stay true to your ideals and vision.
    * Focus on staying positive, and creating the best possible organization.
    * You can't make waves without rocking some boats!
