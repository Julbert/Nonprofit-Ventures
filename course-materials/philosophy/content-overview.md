Half the battle is getting folks into the right mindset. When the intentions are pure, the path will appear.. :-)

I approach business in the most holistic sense - it is mixing self-actualization, making a living, meaningful work, and social benefit.

* Business as a form of spirituality
* Business as a form of self-expression
* Business as a form of activism

In this context, non-profit business starts to make a lot of sense
