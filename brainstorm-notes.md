# Brainstorm Notes for 'Social Ventures' - the Non-Profit Company Incubator

## About Fiscal Fundraising Institutions

Business is the problem.  Business can also be the solution.
The solution to many societal and global problems is rooted in social entrepreneurship - decentralized and human-based

The purchasing power of companies and governments is a powerful force
Companies vote with their Euros for the world that they want to live in
It's a choice to support social entrepreneurs and local initiatives

Affect change via purchasing - not donations or subsidies

Explain FFI. 

Companies want non-profit suppliers.
(Clarification by John: companies want suppliers where 
they know the supplier works based on situation where the quality/correctness of
the product is key to the way the supplier does business, and not the urge to 
make as much money as possible off the product, or the pressure of share holders
to make the product as cheaply as possible. This is often reflected in the phrase
where "some huge accomplishment" was based on "the lowest bidder". A "non-profit 
supplier" can become a very successful and wealthy supplier, but not based on a 
drive to extract as much money from the process as possible. A company wants a 
supplier where profit is not the primary motivation, or even the secondary. 
Profit may be necessary to survive and grow, but it should not be a motive all 
by itself.)

Non-profit company principles:
- Non-profit (FFI)
- Decentralized management(?), ala Holocracy/Teal
- Choose an ANBI Stichting to support that is close in purpose to the purpose of the FFI being started
- Needs volunteers to help as well

## Case study: Radically Open Security

Explain ROS.
ROS is far enough along to serve as a successful case study now. Now we can start teaching other people how to do it..

The way forward for ROS:
- From a company to a community.
- And from a community to a movement. 

## Why We Need A Nonprofit Company Incubator

The same principles also apply to startup financing
You can use your capital to bootstrap and support non-profit companies (FFIs)
That way you can help to build the supplier that you want the world to have
Venture Capital embeds the wrong values from the very beginning

Gives social entrepreneurs community and financial support and guidance building companies with non-profit values
Interest-free loans?   (B2B crowdfunding is better)

(Clarification by John: the ROS way of doing business can grow into a FFI supporting platform methodology. 
We bring together in one place: companies in need of a service on one end of the 
spectrum, and people/companies/professionals who can deliver that service on the 
other end of the spectrum. A good FFI building on the platform solely exist to 
facilitate the delivery of the service (including the entire process from 
quote-writing to invoicing and payments).  Most of the work a good FFI does will be curating both suppliers and consumers of 
a service, and making this as frictionless as possible, with automation and modern 
software facilitating the drudgery) 

This is all quintessentially Dutch
- the "poldermodel" is an important way the Dutch set policy: not share holders, or owners, or politicians, or 
some other powerful agent sets polity, but all stake holders together. Key phrase there: stake holder. 
This includes not only the finance providers, but also consumers, citizens, employees, etc.
- NL is a social-capitalist country
- FFI is a construction only found in the Netherlands
- ROS could have only started in NL
- Similarly, NL is the perfect place to start + prototype a non-profit company incubator
- In the modern interconnected world, we are ALL stake holders


## 'Nonprofit Ventures' Business Model

- The FFI Incubator would be an FFI itself (naturally)
- It needs to cover its own costs when bootstrapping + operating (no subsidies)
- Companies can do B2B crowdfunding of the FFI suppliers that they would like to purchase services from, that doesn't exist yet.

How it would work:
- Wannabee social entrepreneurs would apply for the program
- We'd literally run a startup Bootcamp on how to create an FFI 
- And we'd find companies in advance who request certain kinds of services they want to purchase
- We'd start from the demand of the customer
- (Perhaps a percentage of that could fund the creation and delivery of the curriculum) 
- (There's plenty of services that could use an industry shake-up) 
- The goal is an initial "graduating class" of FFIs
- And financially sustainable model to run the incubator + give bootcamps forever 
- I think that we can easily find students / partners / companies 
- It also shouldn't be difficult to get PR for this idea
- It's a crazy idea - which is perfectly crystal clear and obvious (when reflecting upon it)
- (Just like a non-profit computer security consultancy company)
- I think that it should be reasonably doable to implement. 
- We just need to find partners to help, because we're already busy with ROS.
- We can leverage ROS for the incubator.  The incubator will also likely call positive attention to ROS.
- The curriculum could perhaps also eventually be published as an open-source book, with a Pay What You Want model.
- And the payment could support the incubator 
- This is worth a brainstorm session.
- I think that we need to get all of this down on paper. 

The incubator:
- The incubator itself needs to embody the principles that we'd be teaching in the curriculum
- No venture capital. No subsidies. Pure bootstrapping via the sweat equity of founders (and volunteers), and selling services to launching customers.
- And then using services to bootstrap the creation of products/open-source IP
- The entire curriculum and course materials would be open-sourced. Naturally.. ðŸ˜‰
- And the initial staff will be a collective of independent third parties organized in a fashion that's win-win.
- Just like ROS. 
- There wouldn't be an office either.  The initiative would get itself started purely online.
- That way the incubator itself can cheaply bootstrap itself
- It's pure B2B crowdfunding - a concept that almost doesn't exist in practice, as far as I know 
- Perhaps sharing our open-source infra (and helping them to get started with using it) would also be part of the value proposition of the FFI Incubator.

## Potential Partners

I think that we can get a lot of initial traction for this.

Public call for support for commercial companies
Can they help to create/support an FFI incubator?
WHO WANTS TO HELP???

Who might be able to help: RevNext?  Astrid?  Nijenrode?  ACE Venture Lab?  Companies?
We need to find partners of all kinds

What's in it for you?
Build the suppliers that you want to hire in
Good PR?


## TODO List

- Create a webpage 
- Register a legal entity
- Create a logo and house style
- Rally potential partners of various kinds
- Choose an ANBI Stichting for the FFI to support
- Decide who to ask to join our Advisory Board

## Actions already taken

### 3 Feb
1. Announce idea at Bilderberg Conference
### 5 Feb
2. Create a Gitlab repo for these notes
3. Starting to setup meetings/calls with strategic partners and volunteers
4. Brainstorm about a working name for the Incubator
5. Discuss: if the Incubator is going to be an FFI, which ANBI Stichting would it be supporting?  (NLnet?  Someone else?)
6. Choose 'Nonprofit Ventures' as working name.  (We can always change it later, but this allows us to get started)
7. Check that the name isn't already taken in KvK / EUIPO / USPTO
8. Register domain name 'nonprofit.ventures' + SSL cert
9. Email notary to prepare for registration w/ KvK
10. Register Github organization + Twitter handle + Slack account
11. Reject the idea of using Slack.  We'll use RocketChat (in a separate VM instead).
### 6 Feb
12. Setup RocketChat in a new VM
13. 2 physical meetings and 1 phone call with potential partners
14. Brainstorm about what kindof Foundation (ANBI Stichting) Nonprofit Ventures will want to support.  We think that it should perhaps have something to do with (social) entrepreneurship.
15. Starting to think about who we should ask to join the Social Ventures advisory board

(It's useful to document this, because this list may eventually become a part of the curriculum we're teaching.)  Similar to ROS, the Incubator itself should self as a case-study for how someone can do it.   :-)
