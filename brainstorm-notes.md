# Brainstorm Notes for 'Social Ventures' - the Non-Profit Company Incubator

* [Nonprofit Companies?](about-ffis.md)

## Case study: Radically Open Security

Explain ROS.
ROS is far enough along to serve as a successful case study now. Now we can start teaching other people how to do it..

The way forward for ROS:
- From a company to a community.
- And from a community to a movement. 

## Why We Need A Nonprofit Company Incubator

The same principles also apply to startup financing
You can use your capital to bootstrap and support non-profit companies (FFIs)
That way you can help to build the supplier that you want the world to have
Venture Capital embeds the wrong values from the very beginning

Gives social entrepreneurs community and financial support and guidance building companies with non-profit values
Interest-free loans?   (B2B crowdfunding is better)

(Clarification by John: the ROS way of doing business can grow into a FFI supporting platform methodology. 
We bring together in one place: companies in need of a service on one end of the 
spectrum, and people/companies/professionals who can deliver that service on the 
other end of the spectrum. A good FFI building on the platform solely exist to 
facilitate the delivery of the service (including the entire process from 
quote-writing to invoicing and payments).  Most of the work a good FFI does will be curating both suppliers and consumers of 
a service, and making this as frictionless as possible, with automation and modern 
software facilitating the drudgery) 

This is all quintessentially Dutch
- the "poldermodel" is an important way the Dutch set policy: not share holders, or owners, or politicians, or 
some other powerful agent sets polity, but all stake holders together. Key phrase there: stake holder. 
This includes not only the finance providers, but also consumers, citizens, employees, etc.
- NL is a social-capitalist country
- FFI is a construction only found in the Netherlands
- ROS could have only started in NL
- Similarly, NL is the perfect place to start + prototype a non-profit company incubator
- In the modern interconnected world, we are ALL stake holders


## 'Nonprofit Ventures' Business Model

- The FFI Incubator would be an FFI itself (naturally)
- It needs to cover its own costs when bootstrapping + operating (no subsidies)
- Companies can do B2B crowdfunding of the FFI suppliers that they would like to purchase services from, that doesn't exist yet.

How it would work:
- Wannabee social entrepreneurs would apply for the program
- We'd literally run a startup Bootcamp on how to create an FFI 
- And we'd find companies in advance who request certain kinds of services they want to purchase
- We'd start from the demand of the customer
- (Perhaps a percentage of that could fund the creation and delivery of the curriculum) 
- (There's plenty of services that could use an industry shake-up) 
- The goal is an initial "graduating class" of FFIs
- And financially sustainable model to run the incubator + give bootcamps forever 
- I think that we can easily find students / partners / companies 
- It also shouldn't be difficult to get PR for this idea
- It's a crazy idea - which is perfectly crystal clear and obvious (when reflecting upon it)
- (Just like a non-profit computer security consultancy company)
- I think that it should be reasonably doable to implement. 
- We just need to find partners to help, because we're already busy with ROS.
- We can leverage ROS for the incubator.  The incubator will also likely call positive attention to ROS.
- The curriculum could perhaps also eventually be published as an open-source book, with a Pay What You Want model.
- And the payment could support the incubator 
- This is worth a brainstorm session.
- I think that we need to get all of this down on paper. 

The incubator:
- The incubator itself needs to embody the principles that we'd be teaching in the curriculum
- No venture capital. No subsidies. Pure bootstrapping via the sweat equity of founders (and volunteers), and selling services to launching customers.
- And then using services to bootstrap the creation of products/open-source IP
- The entire curriculum and course materials would be open-sourced. Naturally.. ðŸ˜‰
- And the initial staff will be a collective of independent third parties organized in a fashion that's win-win.
- Just like ROS. 
- There wouldn't be an office either.  The initiative would get itself started purely online.
- That way the incubator itself can cheaply bootstrap itself
- It's pure B2B crowdfunding - a concept that almost doesn't exist in practice, as far as I know 
- Perhaps sharing our open-source infra (and helping them to get started with using it) would also be part of the value proposition of the FFI Incubator.

## Potential Partners

I think that we can get a lot of initial traction for this.

Public call for support for commercial companies
Can they help to create/support an FFI incubator?
WHO WANTS TO HELP???

Who might be able to help: RevNext?  Astrid?  Nijenrode?  ACE Venture Lab?  Companies?
We need to find partners of all kinds

What's in it for you?
Build the suppliers that you want to hire in
Good PR?
