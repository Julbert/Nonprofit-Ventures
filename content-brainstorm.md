# Brainstorming about Course Material Content

Here are some rough ideas about how to structure the actual content of the course itself..

* Part of the content will be business/entrepreneurship related (business model canvas, lean startup, funding and investment (why vs. why not?), management structure, open-source, etc..)
* Another part of the content can be more philosophical, including some stuff about: creativity, activism, spirituality (in a non-religious sense), self-care, and how to lead a meaningful life.
* Half the battle is getting folks into the right mindset.  When the intentions are pure, the path will appear..   :-)
