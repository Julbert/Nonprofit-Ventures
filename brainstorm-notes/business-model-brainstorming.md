# Discussion Part 1

(This is a raw chat transcript.  It hasn't been edited into something concise and coherent yet)

* We can create an ANBI Stichting to support NPVs activities.
* This would give us the flexibility to use NPV profits for exactly the kind of activities we want to support. On the other hand: would it create additional overhead that we need to take care of? Is that worth it considering that NPV would likely not make a ton of profit? Maybe it is worth it in the long term - could we first stick with an existing one (like NL net) and then later create a own NPV one?
* "Is that worth it considering that NPV would likely not make a ton of profit?" <---- this is true, in any case. It would take years before NPV has any possibility of profit. (And even then - it's not profit that we're after.)
"Maybe it is worth it in the long term - could we first stick with an existing one (like NL net) and then later create a own NPV one? " <---- also true. But then we still have to choose one.
* The problem with choosing a 3rd party ANBI Stichting is that they might actually expect to receive money in the short-to-medium term
* And I don't know if that's a promise that we can keep.
* Remember that, it took 3 years for ROS to give NLnet their first donation.
* They were okay with that because they share our vision, and don't need the money that much.
* But I'm not sure how a less well aligned and/or less "rich" ANBI Stiching would feel about this
* That's part of what I'm a bit conflicted about
* We're publicly promising financial support to a third party Stichting - but then I also realize that it will take us a long time to deliver on that promise
* Because turning a profit isn't the point of what we're creating.
* So in that sense, having our own ANBI Stichting is more honest.
* Do you know what I mean?

* Maybe NLnet is the safest bet as the Stichting for NPV.
* Since they have a total understanding of what we're trying to do.
* And they have little to no expectations of what will come out of NPV.
* NLnet is not really relevant for NPV. But it's a safe bet to avoid misunderstandings..
* (And if we find a better ANBI Stichting, we can always change it again later.)
* (But at least it would allow us to take the next steps with NPV, in registering us officially as an FFI)
* (And it would take the time pressure off to find a different Stichting. So we can eventually choose one because it fits - not because we're in a rush.)
* (We should also keep in mind that EVERY aspiring FFI will face this issue. This issue might be useful to describe in the course materials..)
* It's hard to create an FFI, if there's no obvious ANBI Stichting to align with.
* We need to find some more generic answer..
* Otherwise, this will prevent folks from starting FFIs - because they won't be able to get past this issue.
* (That is one benefit of creating your own ANBI Stichting. It's a generic solution.) 

# Discussion Part 2

* NPV does need to have some kindof business model to stay afloat.
* (Giving free trainings/classes/workshops/startup bootcamps isn't a business model.)
* But in such a way - we could consider the free activities to be bizdev, and consultancy would pay NPV's bills. 

* When I bootstrapped ROS, it was lean and mean because I only paid staff when there was paid work from customers to do.
* Regarding Nonprofit Ventures: in a sense, ROS is the "launching customer" of NPV
* And NPV needs to have a business model to itself be sustainable.
* If anyone (myself included) is getting paid at the beginning, without there being *any* source of income coming in, then NPV won't be a sustainable model for others to copy.
* Basically ROS would be a "funding agency" for NPV. Not a customer...
* So I think that we need to think carefully about NPV's business model here. 

* (I'm not personally billing anything to NPV - so in my case ROS is providing "sweat equity".)
* I don't think that this is a fundamental problem - if we consider ROS to be a "launching customer" of NPV, than we can creatively figure out a way that staff's work can ALSO add value to ROS, in a way that ROS doesn't mind paying for.
* But I do think that we need to explicitly think about this. Otherwise NPV will become a pit into which ROS is endlessly throwing money, to provide free services to the world, and it won't be able to sustainably cover its own costs.
* In the longer-run, NPV will need to have other paying customers besides ROS to be viable.
* The B2B crowdfunding thing is a longer-term vision for earning income for NPV.
* But in the short-term, I think that NPV could find other "launching customers" by providing consultancy services and trainings for companies. (Which would be paid.) 
* NPV does need to be able to (somehow) cover its own costs, otherwise it isn't sustainable.
* We just need to creatively figure out how. 
* NPV as bizdev for ROS is the primary justification for paying this right now.
* But it would be good to make all of this more explicit. 

* ROS is also making an "interest free loan" to NPV, that NPV should eventually repay.
* (When considering things like ROS's payment of the notarial, bookkeeping, and bank costs for NPV.)
* (We have to keep track of all of that.)

* I think that all of this is important - because NPV should bootstrap itself by dogfooding the principles that it's teaching to the students.
* So that's why I think that this discussion of cost-covering, financial sustainability, demonstrated value to a launching customer (ROS), and interest-free loans (from ROS) is very relevant and important. 

* I guess that also part of what triggered me on this was a conversation that I had yesterday:
* A guy said "startups need capital from investors to get started". And I refuted him, saying "no - startups don't necessarily need capital from investors because they can bootstrap with launching customers. You just need to be creative about the business model".
* I guess what I'm trying to say is... I want to make sure that ROS is a "launching customer" of NPV and not an "investor", "funding agency", or "NGO". Do you know what I mean?
* I think that this distinction is important, to validate NPV's own principles.. 

# Discussion Part 3

* I just read the following quote: “Ik vond het lastig dat ik als freelancer zo vaak afhankelijk was van andere partijen. En dat ik, tussen projecten in, soms wel een paar maanden niks had. Daarna voelde het alsof ik opnieuw moest beginnen. Nu ik meer leer ondernemen, kan ik beter een lijn uitstippelen voor mezelf.” - Mira van der Lubbe, actrice en theatermaker 

* It makes me wonder if there's a way to help creative folks (artists, musicians, etc..) find decently paid work-from-home flexwork. That would probably already help out the sector alot, by taking away some of their financial stress. (And allowing them to fill in their hours between practicing/training and performances in an ad-hoc fashion - but then also allowing them the freedom and flexibility to perform their craft as needed.)
* Basically helping them to find online PA work or something similar.
* Because right now, artists that I know clean houses, do secretarial work, and other random jobs (below their education level) that usually involve physically going somewhere + have hours that are not always flexible to make ends meet. 
* A nonprofit uitzendbureau (FFI) for folks in the cultural sector - to help them find online flexwork with fair wages - would be cool. 
* In such a way, FFIs could provide creative folks with a kindof "Universal Basic Income" - a living wage for a minimum number of online flexhours.
* Lemme think.. the Universal Basic Income experiment in Utrecht was ~1200 Euros/month.
* For 30 Euros/hour (a fair wage for highly educated but specifically untrained staff, IMHO), that is 40 hours of work per month.
Which is about 9-10 hours of work per week.
* Which is 2 hours/day spread across a workweek, or 1-1.5 workdays if the time is chunked.
* That's a small amount of work for a living wage, leaving plenty of time left over for "other stuff".

* The uitzendbureau could subcontract the staff out to the customer for a slightly higher hourly rate (35-40 Euros/hour?) to support the uitzendbureau's overhead + be able to continue paying staff during the periods between engagements. (The uitzendbureau would be responsible for finding customers and allocation of the work, similar to ROS.)
* I predict that there would be *no* issues with hiring talent! 😆
The customers would be the hard part.. (but if it's a social enterprise supporting the cultural and nonprofit sector.. how hard would it be to find customers?) 

# Discussion Part 4

* Remember my idea before about consultancy for creative types: we can provide them with a completely flexible and 100% remote work arrangement that provides them with a kindof "universal basic income" so they can take care of some of their financial worries but still have space/time for their creativity.

* To help them take care of their physical needs (food, shelter) while they are putting their creativity into their art/activism.

* So basically the free NPV educational activities could attract both producers and consumers in a freelance platform economy, whose purpose is helping to give people a part-time flexible remote work-based Basic Income, but in the most conducive possible way for stimulating people's creativity. 🙂

* We could start with creatives (artists, activists) as the producer
* And companies/organizations who like NPV's mission and want to support it could be the consumer. 

* For now, I'd put some requirements on the producers - they do need to be educated. (Bachelors degree minimum.) To help maintain a particular quality level of the producer starting out..  since a reputation for quality is totally critical when getting started.

* Perhaps later on, we could include producers in more difficult situations - uneducated, poverty, refugees, 50+(?), etc..
* But for now, I think that Quality Assurance might be difficult, it's not the easiest segment to begin with.

* It wouldn't matter what the BSc is in. It could be French literature or tuba.
* We could also have a price (and payment) difference for folks with a BSc vs. MSc.
* Not sure if it's fair/reasonable, but it's just a thought
* To reward folks who did invest in higher education for themselves.

* The producers could basically do online "virtual assistant" kinds of work - or other stuff if they have other skills
* (The more relevant the skills fit between the producer-consumer, the better, naturally..)
* But this is the kindof thing that could be bootstrapped quite cheaply 

* Of course, this flexwork program wouldn't be required for course/training participants to participate in the freelance ecosystem sustaining the business
* It would be fully optional - it should only be used if it's in their own best interest
* The platform would be online and facilitated in a similar fashion as ROS 

* Consultancy is a more immediate alternative for making NPV cost-covering than the B2B crowdfunding percentage
* We could always move things in that direction in the long term
* But I do think that consultancy is (always) a very long hanging fruit in terms of getting something bootstrapped and quickly financially viable.
* (Even if that's not the ultimate destination in the long run) 

* I do think maybe online and 100% flexwork might be non-negotiable
* The creatives need time and space for their creative energy, performances, travels, artists in residency, whatever..
* So probably on-site placements is a no go.
* (Unless the creative specifically prefers it that way.)
* It might also make sense to place a maximum on the number of hours the consumer is allowed to work with us. To ensure that this is a Basic Income and it doesn't become a full-time job that crowds out their creative energy.
* (I think that this is important. We aren't trying to lure creatives away from their art with good hourly wages that they couldn't otherwise get.)
* The height of the Basic Income could potentially also be geographically determined. (Based upon rent prices, etc..) 🤔 

 * But the basic methodology can be this:
  * Bootstrap services with consultancy
  * Bootstrap products with services
* In such a way, service (and eventually product) companies can be started without requiring external capital
* Which eliminates the "special interest" from the business.
* And if those companies are then also setup a social enterprises (or non-profit companies)
* Then.. before we know it.. we've created a better world. 😃 

* If NPV is going to dogfood these same principles.. it would need to start with consultancy as its business model
* And it would also be super logical to make it a platform of freelancers (similar to ROS)
* I suppose that the producers could offer a wide variety of skills (not just online virtual assistant work)
* But it would be a kindof online virtual marketplace to match producers with consumers, in multiple areas.
* We obviously wouldn't be able to start out by facilitating the process as closely as ROS does
* But we could start with a number of producers and consumers (as a case study) to see how that actually works in practice
* And I'm sure that we'd learn something - and then we could iterate our ideas, structure, business model based upon our learnings.

* I'm just thinking out loud here.. it might be possible to put the teaching activities into Stichting NPV. And then put the consultancy arm into NPV BV/FFI.  And then try to make Stichting NPV an ANBI
* It would be a slightly more complicated governance structure, trustwise, because it could raise questions about conflicts of interest that are harder to answer than simply saying "we're giving our money to NLnet, they are an independent 3rd party".
* But on the other hand - it makes sense. And it's a coherent story, in a way that having NPV FFI donate to NLnet isn't. 
* It would also prototype a solution for cases, which I imagine that more FFI founders will share, the dilemma of "crap, I can't find an ANBI Stichting that matches the cause that I want to support"

* This could really be win on so many levels..
* Because the BV/FFI would be improving the world (as a non-profit business) by providing "Basic Incomes" for creative types with FAIR wages and a cap on hours so as not to block their creativity.
* And then the Stichting would be the Nonprofit Ventures educational arm, that is providing the free courses, trainings, workshop, startup bootcamps, open-source materials, etc...
* The two parts would support each other
* NPV Stichting is bizdev for NPV BV/FFI
* And NPV BV/FFI is the source of income for Stichting NPV.
* Hence the circle closes

* Eventually, this would be a completely separate thing from ROS.
* And it would have a different CEO.
* (Since I can't run 2 businesses at the same time)
* But we can keep them merged at the moment, during the bootstrapping process.
* It would just split off once NPV is actually able to stand on its own 2 feet
🤔
* I think that this could succeed for all of the same reasons that ROS did. 🙂 

* But what I like best about this idea is that NPV would be 100% eating its own dogfood
* It would be structuring (and bootstrapping) things in the exact same way as it's teaching
* Thus making it a 2nd good case study on how to create and run a Nonprofit Business
* (As opposed to just creating a foundation that gives away free trainings) 

* We can start out by surveying potential customers, to see what the market wants.. I envision that it would be something sortof like: what kindof freelance services would you want to buy from a non-profit business with our particular set of ideas? What kindof people should the freelancers be? What price point do you think would be reasonable for these services? What risks would you be worried about? Would you be willing to commit to purchasing these freelance services, if we build the vehicle? 

# Discussion Part 5

* Okay.. brace yourselves.. I have some more ideas about the NPV business model that are downright bizarre. 😉
* So I said that anyone is allowed to participate in the "Basic Income" online flexwork program that NPV BV/FFI would be using to finance Stichting NPV's educational activities..
* This means that, in principle, not just creative types, but also business or ICT types could choose to participate in the flexwork program, also receiving a "Basic Income", along with a massive amount of free time.
* If this is indeed the case, we can obviously bill out the business/ICT types for a higher rate to the companies than the creative types. (Since they have more relevant and marketable skills for a large business/organization.)
* But this extra money could allow us to also provide some extra benefits for the business/ICT types.
* For the creatives/activists, we are teaching them about entrepreneurship.
* For the business/ICT types, we need to be teaching them about art, activism, and creativity.
* For the business/ICT types.. envision the following.. in the scads of free time that they have while participating in the NPV "Basic Income" flexwork program, we could offer them some kindof Artist in Residence position within local art/music/theatre/activism/etc.. organizations. (We would pay the artistic institutions for their cooperation - using the extra money that we're billing the customers, due to the ICT/business person's more specialized skills.)
* In such a way, the left-brain (rational) type would have the chance to be dumped into an environment that is filled with creativity, art, meaning, purpose, etc...
* And they could additionally learn some artistic/activistic skill (music, painting, writing, theatre, NGO work, whatever..) that they could take along with them in their personal development, to help make them into more well-rounded people.

* This would also help to cultivate the interest in the left-brain person to WANT to do a nonprofit business, rather than a traditional one.
* Because they might start to see the world from a different perspective.
* We could perhaps also organize an informal Artists Way group for the left-brainers
https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B006H19H3M/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=
* This would then be part of our value proposition for getting left-brain and right-brain folks to both meet somewhere in the middle.
* We would teach artists/activist about entrepreneurship
* We would teach business/ICT people are creativity, art, and activism
* And we would teach EVERYONE about Nonprofit Businesses.
* And then we'd stimulate them with the following thought:
  * "Make your next art project a business"
  * OR
  * "Make your next business an art project"
* If business is a canvas upon which creative art can be made, then why not?   :-)

* I could imagine that ICT/business folks would find such a program to be interesting, if anything, for the chance to do something different between their other jobs.
* (I'm not saying that we'd necessarily start with something this complicated at the beginning. But it could eventually be part of a longer-term vision for NPV.)
