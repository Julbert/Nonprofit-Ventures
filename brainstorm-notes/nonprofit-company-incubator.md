# A Nonprofit Company Incubator

* Venture Capital embeds the wrong values into startups from the very beginning
* Non-profit companies (FFIs) need to bootstrap themselves - this requires sweat equity and launching customers
* Companies can pre-purchase services to help launch the supplier that you want the world to have
* A Nonprofit Company Incubator helps aspiring social entrepreneurs, by providing guidance, community, and launching customers
* It's essentially B2B crowdfunding

  * Clarification: the ROS way of doing business can grow into a FFI supporting platform methodology. 
We bring together in one place: companies in need of a service on one end of the 
spectrum, and people/companies/professionals who can deliver that service on the 
other end of the spectrum. A good FFI building on the platform solely exist to 
facilitate the delivery of the service (including the entire process from 
quote-writing to invoicing and payments).  Most of the work a good FFI does will be curating both suppliers and consumers of 
a service, and making this as frictionless as possible, with automation and modern 
software facilitating the drudgery 

Why do companies want to get involved?
* Build the suppliers that you want to hire in
* Good PR?
* I think that we can get a lot of initial traction for this.

This is all quintessentially Dutch
* NL is a social-capitalist country
* FFI is a construction only found in the Netherlands
* ROS could have only started in NL
* Similarly, NL is the perfect place to start + prototype a non-profit company incubator
* In the modern interconnected world, we are ALL stake holders
* The "poldermodel" is an important way the Dutch set policy: not share holders, or owners, or politicians, or 
some other powerful agent sets polity, but all stake holders together. Key phrase there: stake holder. 
This includes not only the finance providers, but also consumers, citizens, employees, etc.
