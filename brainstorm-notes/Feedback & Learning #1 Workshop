Feedback #1 Workshop

- a group of diverse social entrepreneurs are an energetic and powerful setting
- but social entrepreneurs are busy and want to use their time efficiently, thus they appreciate (more) structure 
- inspiration is appreciated, but should be only be a limited part of the program
- among the biggest benefits are the peer-effects (learning from each others experiences, knowledge, network)
- there is a desire to stay in contact digitally (preferably a LinkedIn group)
- a reoccurring theme is: how to successfully combine and reconcile the comercial and social element?
