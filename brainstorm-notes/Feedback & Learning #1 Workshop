Feedback #1 Workshop

- a diverse group of social entrepreneurs are an energetic and powerful setting
- but social entrepreneurs are busy and want to use their time efficiently, thus they appreciate structure
- inspiration is nice, but should be limited
- among the biggest benefits are the peer-effects (learning from each others experiences)
