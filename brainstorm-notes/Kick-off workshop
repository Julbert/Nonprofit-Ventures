10 minute welcome & introducing ourselves

20 minutes for introductions of participants (so whe know who we are working with) and collecting expectations (so whe know what they want, what their ideas are -> we can potentially tailor elements for them)

2h: Then content & interactive modules. Consisting of:

30 minutes: What kind of business do we want to do? non profit business? social entrepreneurship? FFI? ROS case study.

20 minutes: What do we want with NPV
- we want to learn from and with you what aspiring entrepreneurs really need and what we can provide. We appreciate your honest feedback in the process.
- we want to develop our programm in an iterative process and in consultation and co-creation with the participation (lean/design thinking - practicing what we preach).
- we have some hypoteses about what skill are useful for entrepreneurs: agile process & product management, business models & buisness development, legal and finance (FFI), personality & team development
- while currently supported by ROS, we want to make NPV financially independent. We have many ideas how we can make NPV'a activities financially sustainable in the long run: consulting, b2b crowdfunding, institutional partnerships (KVK etc).
- we are convinced that a good and needed product or service will in the end be able to monetize and thus follow a 'product first' strategy.
- we want to practice what we preach, thus NPV is an FFI that will give its future profits to the foundation NL Net and work on an open source principle.
- We are here to serve you, so depending on what you say you want today -> we can organize follow up workshops (potentially using external trainers from our network) based on what you need.
