# Nonprofit Companies

Business is the problem.  Business can also be the solution.
The solution to many societal and global problems is rooted in social entrepreneurship - decentralized and human-based

## Why Nonprofit Companies?

* The purchasing power of companies and governments is a powerful force
Companies vote with their Euros for the world that they want to live in
It's a choice to support social entrepreneurs and local initiatives

* Affect change via purchasing - not donations or subsidies

* Companies want non-profit suppliers.
  * Clarification: companies want suppliers where 
they know the supplier works based on situation where the quality/correctness of
the product is key to the way the supplier does business, and not the urge to 
make as much money as possible off the product, or the pressure of share holders
to make the product as cheaply as possible. This is often reflected in the phrase
where "some huge accomplishment" was based on "the lowest bidder". A "non-profit 
supplier" can become a very successful and wealthy supplier, but not based on a 
drive to extract as much money from the process as possible. A company wants a 
supplier where profit is not the primary motivation, or even the secondary. 
Profit may be necessary to survive and grow, but it should not be a motive all 
by itself.
