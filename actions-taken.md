# Actions Taken

(It's useful to document this, because this list may eventually become a part of the curriculum we're teaching.)  Similar to ROS, the Incubator itself should self as a case-study for how someone can do it.   :-)

### 3 Feb
1. Announce idea at Bilderberg Conference
### 5 Feb
2. Create a Gitlab repo for these notes
3. Starting to setup meetings/calls with strategic partners and volunteers
4. Brainstorm about a working name for the Incubator
5. Discuss: if the Incubator is going to be an FFI, which ANBI Stichting would it be supporting?  (NLnet?  Someone else?)
6. Choose 'Nonprofit Ventures' as working name.  (We can always change it later, but this allows us to get started)
7. Check that the name isn't already taken in KvK / EUIPO / USPTO
8. Register domain name 'nonprofit.ventures' + SSL cert
9. Email notary to prepare for registration w/ KvK
10. Register Github organization + Twitter handle + Slack account
11. Reject the idea of using Slack.  We'll use RocketChat (in a separate VM instead).
### 6-11 Feb
12. Setup RocketChat in a new VM
13. 3 physical meetings and 2 phone calls with potential partners
14. Brainstorm about what kindof Foundation (ANBI Stichting) Nonprofit Ventures will want to support.  We think that it should perhaps have something to do with (social) entrepreneurship.
15. Starting to think about who we should ask to join the Social Ventures advisory board
16. Edit/refactor brainstorm notes and convert into Github Markdown.  Move root to README.md.
### 12-18 Feb
17. 2 physical meetings this week
18. Lots more email correspondence to setup calls/meetings
19. Talk with Notary about setting up the new FFI (and Stichting) - inquire about the costs
20. Brainstorm about the exact legal construction that we want to setup (probably the same construction as ROS)
21. Approach potential bestuursleden for the Stichting (for simplicity's sake, John and Andy are first choice)
22. Brainstorm about who should be the Director of Nonprofit Ventures (decision: probably Melanie, for now)
23. Ask a fiscalist about the negotiations w/ the Belastingdienst about the FFI status
24. Creating alignment with existing (social) entrepreneurship communities (Impact Hub + ACE Venture Lab)
### 19-25 Feb
25. New bestuursleden of Stichting NPV + Director NPV BV (FFI) are now commited to participate
26. Begin registration process of the BV and Stichting with the KvK via notary, now that the structure and people are clear
27. Gave ROS + NPV presentation at networking event - lots of interest!
28. Planning lots more meetings and calls.  Also responding to LinkedIn messages.
29. Reach out to graphic designer for basic design of logo/house style/website.
### 26 Feb-4 Mar
30. Initial brainstorm version of draft curriculum for FFI "startup bootcamp" on Github
31. Phone call w/ more incubators to possibly partner with
32. Finalize details of the 'aktes van oprichting' (Stichting and BV) with the Notary, and transfer "start capital" for the new BV.  (ROS BV is giving Nonprofit Ventures BV an interest-free loan of 2000 Euros, for the starting capital.)
33. Communicate with graphic designer about requirements for logo/house style/website.
34. Planning more call and meetings
