# Actions Taken

(It's useful to document this, because this list may eventually become a part of the curriculum we're teaching.)  Similar to ROS, the Incubator itself should self as a case-study for how someone can do it.   :-)

### 3 Feb
1. Announce idea at Bilderberg Conference
### 5 Feb
2. Create a Gitlab repo for these notes
3. Starting to setup meetings/calls with strategic partners and volunteers
4. Brainstorm about a working name for the Incubator
5. Discuss: if the Incubator is going to be an FFI, which ANBI Stichting would it be supporting?  (NLnet?  Someone else?)
6. Choose 'Nonprofit Ventures' as working name.  (We can always change it later, but this allows us to get started)
7. Check that the name isn't already taken in KvK / EUIPO / USPTO
8. Register domain name 'nonprofit.ventures' + SSL cert
9. Email notary to prepare for registration w/ KvK
10. Register Github organization + Twitter handle + Slack account
11. Reject the idea of using Slack.  We'll use RocketChat (in a separate VM instead).
### 6 Feb
12. Setup RocketChat in a new VM
13. 2 physical meetings and 1 phone call with potential partners
14. Brainstorm about what kindof Foundation (ANBI Stichting) Nonprofit Ventures will want to support.  We think that it should perhaps have something to do with (social) entrepreneurship.
15. Starting to think about who we should ask to join the Social Ventures advisory board
