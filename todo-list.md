* Create a webpage 
* Decide about the structure of the legal entity that we want to setup?

* Register a legal entity

* Create a logo and house style
* Choose an ANBI Stichting for the FFI to support
* Decide who to ask to join our Advisory Board
* Brainstorm format + content for the "FFI Startup Bootcamp"
* Find helpers = folks who can help us to get this all setup

* Find "customers" = companies/organizations/government that would be interested in purchasing from new FFIs
* Find aspiring social entrepreneurs = who want to participate in the 1st edition of the Startup Bootcamp
* Find matches between the customers and social entrepreneurs
