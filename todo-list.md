# TODO List

If you want to assist with any of these TODO items, send an email to melanie@radicallyopensecurity.com or join us in our [chatroom](https://chat.nonprofit.ventures).

## Setting up the legal entity

* Ping Andy about rescheduling that Skype call
* Talk to Belastingdienst about Nonprofit Ventures FFI status (and the allowed cash buffer) before/after drawing up the articles of incorporation
* Register the Stichting and BV (FFI) via the Notary
  
## Equipping the entity with necessary things

* Setup a bank account for the BV

* Internal RC channel at ROS to discuss the incubator
* A mailing list for interested partners?

* Create a webpage 
* Create a logo and house style
* Choose an ANBI Stichting for the FFI to support

## Assembling a network

* Decide who to ask to join our Advisory Board
* Find helpers = folks who can help us to get this all setup

* Find "customers" = companies/organizations/government that would be interested in purchasing from new FFIs
* Find aspiring social entrepreneurs = who want to participate in the 1st edition of the Startup Bootcamp
* Find matches between the customers and social entrepreneurs
* We can also try to convince existing companies to become FFIs

## Create the content

* Brainstorm format + content for the "FFI Startup Bootcamp"
* Find trainers to teach the bootcamp content
  * (Project Together might be able to donate some trainers)

* Other possible ways to get people more involved:
  * Speed dating between corporate CEOs and social entrepreneurs, and/or pitches, brainstorming together, etc..
  * Long term coaching
    * Project Together has open-sourced their coaching methods - a coach calls once per month to hold entrepreneurs accountable
  * (But I don't necessarily want to commit to doing more than organizing a Startup Bootcamp right now.)
  
## Ideas About Who We Can Approach

We want to rally potential partners of various kinds.  Here's a few ideas:

* Companies - Companies from the Bilderberg Conference
* Incubators - ACE Venture Lab, Startup Bootcamp, Startup Delta
* Universities - Nijenrode
* Individuals - Astrid, Serge, Joan
* Social Entrepreneurship groups - Social-enterprise.nl, Impact Hub, Maatschappelijk Verantwoord Ondernemen (MVO), Knowmads, Delitelabs, Project Together
* Dutch political parties (Groenlinks, D66, etc..)
