# Why We Need A Nonprofit Company Incubator

The same principles also apply to startup financing
You can use your capital to bootstrap and support non-profit companies (FFIs)
That way you can help to build the supplier that you want the world to have
Venture Capital embeds the wrong values from the very beginning

Gives social entrepreneurs community and financial support and guidance building companies with non-profit values
Interest-free loans?   (B2B crowdfunding is better)

(Clarification by John: the ROS way of doing business can grow into a FFI supporting platform methodology. 
We bring together in one place: companies in need of a service on one end of the 
spectrum, and people/companies/professionals who can deliver that service on the 
other end of the spectrum. A good FFI building on the platform solely exist to 
facilitate the delivery of the service (including the entire process from 
quote-writing to invoicing and payments).  Most of the work a good FFI does will be curating both suppliers and consumers of 
a service, and making this as frictionless as possible, with automation and modern 
software facilitating the drudgery) 

Why do companies want to get involved?
* Build the suppliers that you want to hire in
* Good PR?
* I think that we can get a lot of initial traction for this.

This is all quintessentially Dutch
* NL is a social-capitalist country
* FFI is a construction only found in the Netherlands
* ROS could have only started in NL
* Similarly, NL is the perfect place to start + prototype a non-profit company incubator
* In the modern interconnected world, we are ALL stake holders
* The "poldermodel" is an important way the Dutch set policy: not share holders, or owners, or politicians, or 
some other powerful agent sets polity, but all stake holders together. Key phrase there: stake holder. 
This includes not only the finance providers, but also consumers, citizens, employees, etc.
