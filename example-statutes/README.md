Here's the Statutes for Nonprofit Ventures, which are meant to serve as an example of how a Nonprofit Business can be structured.

Please bear in mind that these statutes are an initial attempt, and are a Work In Progress.  (I'm sure that there's plenty of room for improvement - this was a first attempt.)    If you see any possible weaknesses or can suggest improvements, please shoot an email to melanie@radicallyopensecurity.com.
