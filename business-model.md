# 'Nonprofit Ventures' Business Model

* The FFI Incubator would be an FFI itself (naturally)
* It needs to cover its own costs when bootstrapping + operating (no subsidies)
* Companies can do B2B crowdfunding of the FFI suppliers that they would like to purchase services from, that doesn't exist yet.

How it would work:
* Wannabee social entrepreneurs would apply for the program
* We'd literally run a startup Bootcamp on how to create an FFI 
* And we'd find companies in advance who request certain kinds of services they want to purchase
* We'd start from the demand of the customer
* (Perhaps a percentage of that could fund the creation and delivery of the curriculum) 
* (There's plenty of services that could use an industry shake-up) 
* The goal is an initial "graduating class" of FFIs
* And financially sustainable model to run the incubator + give bootcamps forever 
* I think that we can easily find students / partners / companies 
* It also shouldn't be difficult to get PR for this idea
* It's a crazy idea - which is perfectly crystal clear and obvious (when reflecting upon it)
* (Just like a non-profit computer security consultancy company)
* I think that it should be reasonably doable to implement. 
* We just need to find partners to help, because we're already busy with ROS.
* We can leverage ROS for the incubator.  The incubator will also likely call positive attention to ROS.
* The curriculum could perhaps also eventually be published as an open-source book, with a Pay What You Want model.
* And the payment could support the incubator 
* This is worth a brainstorm session.
* I think that we need to get all of this down on paper. 

The incubator:
* The incubator itself needs to embody the principles that we'd be teaching in the curriculum
* No venture capital. No subsidies. Pure bootstrapping via the sweat equity of founders (and volunteers), and selling services to launching customers.
* And then using services to bootstrap the creation of products/open-source IP
* The entire curriculum and course materials would be open-sourced. Naturally.. ðŸ˜‰
* And the initial staff will be a collective of independent third parties organized in a fashion that's win-win.
* Just like ROS. 
* There wouldn't be an office either.  The initiative would get itself started purely online.
* That way the incubator itself can cheaply bootstrap itself
* It's pure B2B crowdfunding - a concept that almost doesn't exist in practice, as far as I know 
* Perhaps sharing our open-source infra (and helping them to get started with using it) would also be part of the value proposition of the FFI Incubator.
* Finding a source of interest-free loans may be helpful for cashflow while growing
